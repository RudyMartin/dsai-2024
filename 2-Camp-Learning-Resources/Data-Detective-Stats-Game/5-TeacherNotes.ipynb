    "## Overview of the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Definition**: `InteractiveGuessingGame` initializes with a list of objects and selects one at random as the secret object. It tracks guesses and attempts.\n",
    "- **Guess Checking**: When a guess is made, it's checked against the secret object, recorded, and the number of attempts is incremented.\n",
    "- **Statistics Calculation**: After the game ends, statistics are calculated for the guesses made, including the count of each object guessed and their respective probabilities.\n",
    "- **Interactive Widgets**: The game uses `ipywidgets` for input and buttons, providing a clear output after each guess. This helps in making the game dynamic and interactive.\n",
    "- **Gameplay Flow**: The player inputs guesses until they either guess correctly or run out of attempts, with statistics displayed at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Present This to Students\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Introduction to ipywidgets**: Start by explaining what `ipywidgets` are and how they make Jupyter Notebooks interactive.\n",
    "- **Game Mechanics**: Describe how the game is played, the role of the `check_guess` function, and how attempts are tracked.\n",
    "- **Data Science Application**: Focus on how the game collects data (guesses) and calculates statistics and probabilities. This can be a practical demonstration of data analysis.\n",
    "- **Hands-On Session**: Let the students play the game themselves in a notebook. Encourage them to modify the list of objects or the code to see how their changes affect the game's behavior.\n",
    "- **Discussion**: After playing, discuss what strategies worked best, what they learned about probability, and how data was used in the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customization**: Encourage students to add more objects or complexity to the game, like different categories of objects or hints.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Introduce simple visualizations using `matplotlib` or `seaborn` to graphically display the results and probabilities.\n",
    "- **Deeper Data Science Concepts**: Depending on their level, introduce concepts like conditional probability or Bayesian inference in the context of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is a fantastic tool for making learning interactive and engaging, providing a real-world application of programming and data science concepts in a fun and accessible way.\n"
