# From Basics to Brilliant: Unlocking the Secrets of CNNs with Rock, Paper, Scissors

Suggestions for turning a baseline image recognition model into a high performance one.

Hereâ€™s a list of questions that students can answer to evaluate and understand the differences between a baseline CNN model and an improved CIFAR-like model for the rock-paper-scissors task:

### Understanding the Models
1. **Describe the architecture**: What are the key layers and features of the baseline CNN model for rock-paper-scissors? How does it differ from the improved CIFAR-like model?
2. **Parameters**: How many parameters does each model have? Which model is more complex and why?

### Performance Evaluation
3. **Accuracy**: What is the accuracy of the baseline model compared to the improved model on the training and validation datasets?
4. **Overfitting**: Is there any evidence of overfitting in either of the models? Which metrics would indicate this?
5. **Loss Analysis**: Compare the training and validation loss curves for both models. What do these curves tell you about the learning process of each model?

### Model Improvements
6. **Feature Maps**: How do the feature maps from the early and late layers of the CNN differ between the baseline and improved models? What can this tell us about the features each model is learning?
7. **Regularization Techniques**: What kind of regularization techniques are used in each model? How do these techniques affect the models' performance?
8. **Data Augmentation**: How does the use of data augmentation differ between the two models, and what impact does it have on their performance?

### Computational Aspects
9. **Training Time**: How does the training time compare between the baseline and improved models? What factors contribute to the difference in training time?
10. **Inference Time**: Compare the inference time between the two models. Which model is faster during inference, and why might this be the case?

### Advanced Analysis
11. **Confusion Matrix**: Analyze the confusion matrices for both models. Which classes are most commonly confused in each model?
12. **Sensitivity and Specificity**: How do sensitivity (recall) and specificity change from the baseline to the improved model for each class?

These questions can guide students through a comprehensive analysis of how different techniques and adjustments can enhance the performance of a CNN model, specifically applied to a rock-paper-scissors classification task.
