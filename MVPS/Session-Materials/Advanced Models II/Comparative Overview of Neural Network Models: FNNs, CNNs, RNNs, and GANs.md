| **Core Idea**                   | Direct connections forward, no cycles       | Layers with convolutions to process images | Cycles in network for sequence processing  | Two networks contesting: generator & discriminator |
| **Use Case**                    | Classification problems                     | Image recognition                          | Text generation, time series              | Image generation                           |
| **Data Type**                   | Any kind of labelable data                  | Image data                                 | Sequential data (e.g., text, time series) | Image data                                 |
| **Training**                    | Supervised learning                         | Supervised learning                        | Supervised or unsupervised                | Unsupervised learning                      |
| **Network Flow**                | Linear flow (input to hidden to output)     | Multiple layers including pooling, dense   | Feedback loops internally                 | Feedback between generator and discriminator |
| **Key Operations**              | Matrix multiplication, activations          | Convolution, activation, pooling           | Recurrent transformations, state management| Training via conflict, balance             |
