Here are four classic examples of notebooks for each type of neural network:

### 1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)
A simple implementation of a feedforward neural network for a classification problem.

**Notebook Example**: [Basic Classification: Classify images of clothing](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)

### 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
An implementation of a CNN for image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Notebook Example**: [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with CIFAR-10 Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn)

### 3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
An RNN example for text generation using a character-based language model.

**Notebook Example**: [Text generation with an RNN](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation)

### 4. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
A classic GAN implementation for generating images using the MNIST dataset.

**Notebook Example**: [Basic GAN with MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan)

These links lead to tutorials on TensorFlow's official website, where you can find detailed explanations and code for each type of neural network.
