    "## Introduction to \"Data Detective: The Mystery Object Guessing Game\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to \"Data Detective,\" a fun and interactive guessing game where you play the role of a detective trying to uncover the secret identity of a mysterious object. In this game, not only will you test your guessing skills, but you'll also dive into some basic concepts of data science like probability and statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Game Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Your goal is to guess a secret object chosen randomly from a list. You have a limited number of guesses to figure out what the object is.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gameplay\n",
    "- You'll input your guesses through an interactive interface.\n",
    "- After each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether you were right or wrong.\n",
    "- If wrong, you're encouraged to try again until you either guess correctly or exhaust your attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Science Twist\n",
    "- After each game, we'll look at statistics of the guesses madeâ€”for instance, how many times each object was guessed.\n",
    "- We'll calculate the probability of each guess. This means we'll see how likely it was that each object would be guessed based on the number of attempts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Thinking**: Develop your ability to think critically and make informed guesses based on previous outcomes.\n",
    "- **Understanding Data**: Learn about basic data handling and probability calculations, seeing firsthand how data can inform decisions.\n",
    "- **Interactive Learning**: Engage with a live, interactive module that makes learning about data science fun and accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Play This Game?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Data Detective\" isn't just about guessing; it's about learning to think like a data scientist. You'll get practical experience with statistical concepts and understand how they apply to everyday decision-making. Plus, it's a great way to sharpen your analytical thinking skills in a fun, competitive environment.\n"
