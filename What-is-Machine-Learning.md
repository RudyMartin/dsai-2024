Machine Learning (ML) encompasses various techniques, each suitable for different types of tasks and data. Here are the main techniques:

### Supervised Learning
1. **Definition**: Supervised learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, which means that each training example is paired with an output label.
2. **Goal**: The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs based on the provided examples.
3. **Techniques**:
   - **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like size and location).
   - **Classification**: Predicting discrete labels (e.g., identifying whether an email is spam or not).

### Unsupervised Learning
1. **Definition**: Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data, where the model tries to identify patterns and structures within the data.
2. **Goal**: The aim is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data.
3. **Techniques**:
   - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation in marketing).
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while retaining important information (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).

### Reinforcement Learning
1. **Definition**: Reinforcement learning involves training an agent to make a sequence of decisions by rewarding or punishing it based on the actions it takes.
2. **Goal**: The goal is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative rewards over time.
3. **Techniques**:
   - **Q-Learning**: Learning the value of taking a particular action in a particular state.
   - **Policy Gradients**: Directly learning the policy that maps states to actions.

### Neural Networks
1. **Definition**: Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that can learn to represent and process data.
2. **Goal**: The aim is to approximate complex functions that can map inputs to desired outputs, often used in deep learning.
3. **Techniques**:
   - **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: The simplest type of neural network where information moves in one direction from input to output.
   - **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for processing grid-like data, such as images, using convolutional layers to detect patterns.
   - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data, like time series or natural language, with connections that form directed cycles to maintain a memory of previous inputs.
   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Consisting of two networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete to produce realistic data samples.

### Summary of Techniques
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data for tasks like regression and classification.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data for tasks like clustering and dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Trains agents through reward-based feedback for decision-making tasks.
- **Neural Networks**: Utilizes interconnected neurons for complex data representation, with specific types for different data structures and tasks.
